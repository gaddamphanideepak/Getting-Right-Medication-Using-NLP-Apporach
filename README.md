# Getting-Right-Medication-Using-NLP-Apporach
## 1. Introduction 
In this project we present our approach to Get Right Medication using NLP model trained on a dataset comprising 215063 instances with 7 variables.
## 2. Dataset
1. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/462/drug+review+dataset+drugs+com (Dataset from UC Irvine ML Repository)
2. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/149EVquMSPL7RXrLfNC-XpGmmQe08O_3g?usp=sharing
3. Open this link.
4. Drug Folder should be added to the shortcut in google drive.
5. This will allow us to link between Dataset and Google Colab.

## 3. Why this Dataset? 
1. This dataset consists of Test and Train Data.

## 4. How to Use?
There are a google colab files in the Github. 
1. Medicine_Recommendation_NLP.ipynb
2. https://github.com/gaddamphanideepak/Getting-Right-Medication-Using-NLP-Apporach/blob/main/Medicine_Recommendation_NLP.ipynb
4. This notebook file must be open using google colab and they should be run independently after adding the shortcut of provided dataset in the google drive.
